# `01_introduction.py`

- meet my co-host copilot ... "hello copilot"
- "what is programming?" -> Programming is mostly communicating with other programmers.
- "how can I best work with you?" -> docs-first development

# `02_human_constraints.py`

- perception: 80 words per minute, visual perception: fovea, parafovea,
  perifovea
- attention: process of building cognitive load, can be easily disrupted
- language: names in the program reflect metaphores, e.g., "process sleeps"
- reasoning: computer programs are consistent, not logical: action button on a
  screen consistently performs the wrong action
- emotion: .. positive emotion heightens our ability to hyperfocus (flow state).
  * what we work on is important to us
  * the expected performance is achievable
  * our expertise slightly under-matches the level of difficulty

- Could probably hold a separate talk about each of these subjects

# `03_visual_perception.py`

- let copilot fill out the blanks

# `04_visual_angles.py`

- start writing function `def compute_width_from_angle_in_cm(...)`
- write main block -> # Compute width off object on screen

# Final notes

- with copilot you do docs-first development
- you can write tests to verify that the function is correct
- don't trust copilot / work with him
